module Gonzales
  module FactoryGirl
    # = Gonzales::FactoryGirl::DefinitionProxy
    #
    # Extends FactoryGirl with a new extension
    module DefinitionProxy
      # Define an association in a factory.
      # Supports belongs_to and has_and_belongs_to_many associations
      #
      # speedy will assign the association in the following order:
      #
      #   #. If you have specified the association then insgtantiating creating or building the factory,
      #      it will use that association
      #   #. If the association exists in the database, it will assign that.
      #   #. Lastly, when none of the above, it will create the factory.
      #
      # === Arguments
      #   
      #  * association_name - the name of the association
      #  * factory_name - the name of the factory (if the factory has the same name as the association, this parameter is optional)
      #  * options - a hash to be passed to FactoryGirl when creating the record using factory
      #
      # === Examples
      #
      #    FactoryGirl.define do
      #      factory :organization do
      #        name "Looney tunes"
      #        speedy :contact                                      # association to contact (belongs_to :contact), 
      #               # same as +association :contact+
      #        speedy :addresses, :street_address, :postal_address  # association to addresses (has_many_and_belongs_to_many :addresses)
      #               # same as +addresses { |org| [org.association(:street_address), org.association(:postal_address)] }+
      #      end
      #    end
