      # Define an association in a factory.
      #
      # speedy will assign the association in the following order:
      #
      #   #. If you have specified the association then insgtantiating creating or building the factory,
      #      it will use that association
      #   #. If the association exists in the database, it will assign that.
      #   #. Lastly, when none of the above, it will create the factory.
      #
      # === Arguments
      #   
      #  * association_name - the name of the association
      #  * factory_name - the name of the factory (if the factory has the same name as the association, this parameter is optional)
      #  * options - a hash to be passed to FactoryGirl when creating the record using factory
      #
