module Gonzales
  # = Gonzales provides a mechanism for speeding up tests when using FactoryGirl
  #
  # == Configutations
  #
  #   * factory_module - the module containing the definitions of factories to be store in the test database.
  #                      Defaults to +test/speedy.rb+
  #   * factory_cache  - the entity lookup yaml-file to store factories that was save to the database when Gonzales.initialize! was run
  #                      Defaults to +test/speedy.yml+
  #
  # === Example 
  #
  # Gonzales.configure do |config|
  #   config.factory_module = Rails.root.join('tmp', 'gonzales.yml')
  #   config.factory_cache =  Rails.root.join('test', 'speedy.rb')
  # end

  autoload :Factories,  'gonzales/factories'
  autoload :TestHelper, 'gonzales/test_helper'
  
  include ActiveSupport::Configurable
  config_accessor :factory_module, :factory_cache
  
  # Runs the initialization of Gonzales. Put this in a rake task for your application.
  #
  # === Example
  #
  #   # lib/tasks/gonzales_tasks.rake
  #   namespace :db do
  #     namespace :test do
  #       task :prepare => :environment do
  #         # place your seeds here, if you have any
  #         Gonzales.initialize!
  #       end
  #     end
  #   end
  #
