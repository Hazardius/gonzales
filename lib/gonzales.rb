  # == Configurations
  #
  #   * factory_module  - the module containing the definitions of factories to be store in the test database.
  #                       Defaults to +test/speedy.rb+
  #   * factory_cache   - the entity lookup yaml-file to store factories that was save to the database when Gonzales.initialize! was run
  #                       Defaults to +test/speedy.yml+
  #   * disable_preload - Set to true if you want to disable preload for integration tests. If you are using database_cleaner, you
  #                       will probably also set this one to true.
  #   * adapter         - Set to either :registered or :unregistered. When using database_cleaner with integration_tests and you want
  #                       to reuse associations decleared with speedy, you should set this value to :registered
  # === Example 
  #
  # Gonzales.configure do |config|
  #   config.factory_module = Rails.root.join('tmp', 'gonzales.yml')
  #   config.factory_cache =  Rails.root.join('test', 'speedy.rb')
  # end
  config_accessor :factory_module, :factory_cache, :disable_preload, :adapter

  self.config.class.redefine_method(:adapter=) do |name|
    Gonzales::Adapter.use name
  end

  # def self.adapter=(name)
  #   Adapter.use name
  # end
  
  # Runs the initialization of Gonzales. Put this in a rake task for your application.
  #
  # === Example
  #
  #   # lib/tasks/gonzales_tasks.rake
  #   namespace :db do
  #     namespace :test do
  #       task :prepare => :environment do
  #         # place your seeds here, if you have any
  #         Gonzales.initialize!
  #       end
  #     end
  #   end
  #
